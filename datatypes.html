        <h2>Strings</h2>
                        <h3>Definition</h3>

        <p>A string is a set of characters that are placed inside quotation (single or double) marks. Strings can be assigned to variables, arrays, function, etc. A string can consist of sentences, quotes, numbers, etc. You can add a quote inside of a string as long as it doesnt match what around it. What is written inside of the string is what will be displayed onto the console or the webpage.</p>
        <p>You can combine two seperate strings together to create one. This is called string concatenation. using the addition operator it will add the string on the left to the string on the right. Say you wanted to log a word in all upper-case. Well using the .toUpperCase method will log a woed or a whole string in all capital letters.</p>
        <p>By using the .slice method, it will delete a item in a string in which you selected by using the .index method.You can also figure out the length (amount of characters) of a string using .length method. You can locate something inside of your string using the index method. Using this method allows you to select a specific string inside of a string. If you have an string with multiple strings inside of it, the first item in the string would be at index(0) and so on so forth. This is useful for selecting specific items in a string to change without changing the whole string.</p>

            <li> Add the quote "Everything lost can be found again except for time wasted" into a string</li>
            <li> Declare a variable "My favorite food is ' ' " <br>Add your favorite food into the blank quotation marks inside of the string.</li>
            <li> Declare a variable named "myFavoriteAnimals" <br>Add 3 of your favorite animals into the string. <br>Finally into the console add var myfavoriteAnimals.length to see the size of your string.</li>
            <li> Declare a variable using the let keyword named "numberOfChips" and assign it to the value of 8. <br> Declare a variable using the let keyword named "numberOfCandies" and assign it to the value of 18. <br> Finally declare a variable using the let keyword named "totalSnacks" and set it to the vlaue of "numberOfChips" + "numberOfCandies" and that will be the total amount of snacks that are in stock.</li>

        <h2>Numbers</h2>
                                <h3>Definition</h3>

        <p>In javascript there is only 1 way that you can write numbers. You can only write them with or without decimals. In javascript you can use numbers to solve in equations or put in array in an arguement. You can also use numbers in strings to represent the value. You can also concatenate two strings that consist of numbers.</p>

            <li> Declare a variable using the let keyword named note and set it to the string ["How many pets have I had?"]. <br> Declare another variable using the let keywod named pets and set it to the value of how many pets you have had that you can remember.</li>
            <li> Declare a variable using the let keyword called intake and set it to the value of how many calories you had today. <br> Then declare another variable named daily and set it to the value 2500. <br> Subtract the variable intake from the variable daily in a new variable called total. <br> The value is how many calories you have left till you pass the daily amount.</li>
            <li> Declare a variable named "myFavoriteAnimals" <br>Add 3 of your favorite animals into the string. <br>Finally into the console add var myfavoriteAnimals.length to see the size of your string.</li>

        <h2>Null/Undefined</h2>
                                <h3>Definition</h3>

        <p>Null is a value of no value which can be assigned to variables. When you assign "null" to a variable its like your assigning the value of "nothing". Whereas undefined is a variable that has not value yet. Like a variable, it has been defined but has not been given a value. <br> When you want to alert the typeOf variable that is assigned to null,the return will be object. Although null is not an object, this is a bug that cant be fixed. When the first version of JS was being used, the values were put into 32 bit units. Its part of a historical bug that was created when javascript was first being used.</p>

            <li> Declare a variable called "Y" and set it to the value of null. <br> Create an if/else statement that says: if Y has no value then console.log "null", else console.log "false".</li>
            <li> Declare a variable using the let keyword named "join" and set it to the value of null. <br> After the variable is declared, console.log typeof join. <br> The result is a historical bug.</li>
            <li> Declare a variable named "z" and do not set a value just declare. <br> Then declare another variable using the let keyword named "v" and set it to the string ["What is his age"]. <br> Finally, declare another variable named "total" and set it to the value of v + z. <br>Then log z at the end </li>
            <li> Declare a method named ages and set it equal to the value of all the ages of yor friends. <br> Then use the .sort method to sort that list from youngest to oldest </li>
